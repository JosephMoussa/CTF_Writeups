# PicoCTF 2025 - Cookie Monster Secret Recipe Write-Up

## Challenge Overview:
- **Category:** Web Exploitation
- **Difficulty:** Easy

The objective of this challenge was to exploit a vulnerability related to **cookie manipulation** in a web application. Specifically, we were tasked with extracting the flag hidden within a **cookie** after a failed login attempt. This challenge tests knowledge of **cookie handling**, **base64 decoding**, and **security flaws** related to storing sensitive data in cookies.

---

## Initial Analysis:

Upon launching the challenge, I was greeted with a login page where I could enter credentials. The provided hint in the challenge was:

- **Hint:** "Have you checked your cookies lately?"

After submitting any random credentials (e.g., `test:test`), the website returned an **Access Denied** message with the above hint. This immediately led me to believe that the flag might be hidden in the **cookies**, even after a failed login attempt.

---

## Exploitation Process:

### 1. Inspecting Cookies

Following the hint, I opened the **Cookies** tab in the browser’s developer tools (DevTools) to inspect the cookies stored by the application.

I noticed that even after a failed login attempt, a cookie named **‘secret_recipe’** was set, which could potentially hold the flag or some encoded value.

### 2. Decoding the Cookie Value

Next, I copied the value of the **‘secret_recipe’** cookie and pasted it into **Burp Suite's Decoder**.

In the decoder, I selected the following options:
- **Decode as URL** and then **Decode as Base64**.

The decoded value turned out to be the **flag** in the following format:

## Technical Insight:

- **Cookie Manipulation:** The challenge demonstrated the vulnerability of storing sensitive data, such as the flag, directly in cookies without proper encryption or obfuscation. This makes it easier for an attacker to extract the flag simply by decoding the cookie value.
  
- **Base64 Encoding:** The flag was encoded in **Base64**, which is a common encoding technique used to store binary data in text format. It’s important to note that **Base64** is not secure and can be easily decoded.

- **Web Exploitation:** This challenge reinforces the importance of securing sensitive information by not storing it in easily accessible places like **cookies** without encryption.

---

## Key Skills Demonstrated:

- **Cookie Analysis**: The challenge reinforced the critical skill of inspecting cookies and understanding their role in web applications. In penetration testing and **bug bounty hunting**, identifying improperly secured cookies is a key technique for gaining access to sensitive data.
  
- **Base64 Decoding**: The ability to decode **Base64** encoded strings is a fundamental skill for cybersecurity professionals, particularly in challenges like this where the flag is hidden behind encoding mechanisms.

- **Web Security Awareness**: This challenge highlighted the importance of secure cookie handling, which is often overlooked. Understanding how cookies can be manipulated or exploited in **web applications** is crucial for protecting sensitive data.

---

## Lessons Learned:

- **Never store sensitive data in cookies without proper encryption.** Cookies can be easily accessed by users, and their contents can be decoded if not properly secured.
  
- **Always validate cookie integrity.** Using methods like **HMAC (Hash-Based Message Authentication Code)** can help protect cookies from being tampered with or decoded by attackers.

- **Understand encoding techniques.** Knowing how encoding methods like **Base64** work can be a useful tool in identifying hidden data within web applications.

## Conclusion:

Successfully solving the **Cookie Monster Secret Recipe** challenge highlights the importance of proper **cookie management** in web security. By identifying that the flag was stored in the **‘secret_recipe’** cookie and decoding it, I was able to solve the challenge. This reinforces the need to understand **web exploitation techniques** and the **risks** associated with **cookie storage**.

In real-world penetration testing or **red team** activities, vulnerabilities like improperly secured cookies can often lead to **unauthorized access** to sensitive data.

---

## Tools Used:
- **Burp Suite**: For decoding the **Base64** encoded cookie.
- **Browser Developer Tools (DevTools)**: For inspecting cookies set by the web application.
